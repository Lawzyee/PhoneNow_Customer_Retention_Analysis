# PhoneNow Customer Retention Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for **PhoneNow**, a telecommunications provider, with the goal of improving customer retention strategies. The tasks involved defining KPIs, building visual dashboards, and providing insights and recommendations based on the data.

## Client Request
The engagement partner provided specific inputs for this project. The clientâ€™s retention manager outlined the scope in an email, requesting the development of KPIs and dashboards to monitor customer churn and related metrics.

## Tasks
The following tasks were defined for this project:
1. **Define proper KPIs** for customer retention analysis.
2. **Create a dashboard** for the retention manager to reflect the KPIs and provide actionable insights.

### KPIs Defined
- **Customer Churn Rate:** Percentage of customers who left within a given period.
- **Tenure:** How long customers have stayed with the company.
- **Services Used:** Breakdown of services customers subscribed to, such as phone, internet, online security, etc.
- **Support Tickets:** Number of technical and administrative support tickets raised by customers.
- **Demographics:** Gender, senior citizens, partners, dependents.
- **Billing and Payment Information:** Paperless billing, payment method, monthly and total charges.
  
These KPIs provide a comprehensive view of customer engagement and potential reasons for churn.

## Calculations and Measures
After the initial data cleaning, several measures were created to help analyze the churn and related factors:

1. **Churn Rate %:**
   ```DAX
   Churn rate % = DIVIDE (CALCULATE(COUNT(churn[Churn]), churn[Churn] = "yes" ),CALCULATE ( COUNT (churn[Churn]), ALLSELECTED (churn[Churn] ) ))

2. **Count of Churn (Yes):**
   ```DAX
   Count of Churn for Yes = CALCULATE(COUNTA('churn'[Churn]), 'churn'[Churn] IN { "Yes" })

For more information on Calculations and Measures please see **Calculations and Measures file**
For the analysis, several DAX measures and calculations were used after initial data cleaning. You can download the file containing these calculations from the link below:

## Dashboards
Two interactive dashboards were created using **Power BI** to visualize the data and KPIs:

### 1. Churn Dashboard
This dashboard presents customer churn metrics such as:
- **Customers at risk:** The total number of customers flagged for churn.
- **Demographics breakdown:** Male vs. female customers, senior citizens, and dependents.
- **Payment methods:** The most common payment options, such as electronic checks, bank transfers, etc.
- **Service subscriptions:** Distribution of services like phone service, multiple lines, streaming, tech support, etc.

### 2. Customer Risk Analysis Dashboard
This dashboard provides deeper insights into customer risk by analyzing:
- **Churn rate by internet service type (DSL, Fiber Optic, No service)**
- **Churn rate by contract type and years of contract**
- **Correlation between monthly charges and churn rate**
- **Number of technical and administrative tickets raised**

Both dashboards can be accessed interactively on PowerBI here:

## Key Insights and Recommendations
### Insights:
- **Tenure vs. Churn:** A significant portion of churned customers had a tenure of less than 2 years, suggesting that improving retention efforts for newer customers could greatly reduce churn.
- **Payment Method Correlation:** Customers using **electronic check** as a payment method exhibited a higher churn rate compared to other payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers.
- **Internet Service and Churn:** Customers subscribed to **DSL** services showed higher churn rates, indicating possible dissatisfaction with the quality of service compared to **Fiber Optic**.
- **Support Tickets:** A higher number of administrative and technical tickets are correlated with customer churn, emphasizing the need for better customer support strategies.

### Recommendations:
1. **Retention Campaign for New Customers:** Since a large percentage of churned customers have less than 2 years of tenure, focus on loyalty programs and customer engagement initiatives targeted at new customers.
2. **Improve Support Response Time:** A large number of churned customers raised multiple technical and administrative tickets. Enhancing the customer service experience, particularly for at-risk customers, can significantly improve retention.
3. **Promote Fiber Optic Services:** As customers with Fiber Optic services churn less, it would be beneficial to promote this service to existing DSL customers through upselling campaigns.
4. **Analyze Electronic Check Payments:** Consider offering discounts or incentives for customers using electronic check payment methods to switch to credit cards or direct transfers, which show lower churn rates.

## Conclusion
This analysis, supported by the visualizations, provides a strong foundation for improving customer retention at PhoneNow. Implementing the recommended strategies can help reduce churn and increase customer loyalty.
